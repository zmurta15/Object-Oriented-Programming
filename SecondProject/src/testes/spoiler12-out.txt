S1 EP1: Pilot
Claire and Phil shout up the stairs to the children.
When Haley emerges, Claire tells her that her skirt is too short but Phil allows her to wear it. In side interviews, Phil calls himself a "cool dad" while Claire says that if she can prevent her children from making the same mistakes she did when she was growing up, she has "done our job".
Alex comes downstairs to complain that Luke has shot her with the toy gun Phil bought him.
Claire forces Phil to follow through on his deal with Luke: if Luke shoots someone, Phil will have to shoot him.
Haley invites Dylan, a senior boy from her high school, over.
Claire instructs Phil to "scare him", but Phil hurts his back in the process.
Dylan is forced to carry Phil to the couch.
